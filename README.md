# Simple Hand Tracking with OpenCV

A lightweight and beginner-friendly project that performs real-time hand joint tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. This system uses your webcam to detect and visualize 21 hand landmarks (joints), making it ideal for gesture recognition and interactive applications.

## Features

* ✅ Tracks 21 hand landmarks in real-time
* ✅ Uses webcam as input
* ✅ Overlays hand joints on the video stream
* ✅ Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe
